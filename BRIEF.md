BubbleSort
==========

A skeleton app and test for the bubble sort algorithm.

# Install

1. Fork this repo
2. git clone your own copy to your projects folder.
3. cd ~/projects/BubbleSort

# TODO

Let's add some functionality to the Array class, so that we have some useful
methods.

As of now the test will fail. This is good, as in TDD we like to specify how the program works first, see the test fail, then add the implementation. So you need to finish your implementation so that the test passes!

# To run

```ruby my_amazing_test.rb```

# Submission

Once you're done, push your code to your repo and send me a pull request.
